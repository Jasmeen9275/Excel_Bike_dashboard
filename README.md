Project Title: **Bike Purchase Behavior of Customers**
Project Description:
For this project the dataset is sourced from Kaggle, **containing 1,027 rows** and **13 variables ** including ID, marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home ownership, cars, commute distance, region, age, and bike purchase status. 

**Objective**: To analyze and understand the **purchase behavior of customers** based on various **demographic and socio-economic factors**, and to provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

**Process Followed**:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
The dataset was meticulously sorted and cleaned to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the data. This included **removing any duplicate** entries and **addressing any inconsistencies** within the data.

Using **IF and Nested IF** functions in Excel, a new column named "Age Brackets" was created to categorize the ages into defined ranges. This classification facilitated easier analysis and understanding of age-related trends.

**Data Analysis**
Three pivotal pivot tables were created to showcase the purchasing behavior of customers based on different variables:
Income: Analysis of bike purchases segmented by different income levels.
Gender: Comparative analysis of bike purchases between male and female customers.
Commute Distance: Evaluation of bike purchases based on the distance customers commute.
Age Group: Insight into bike purchases across different age brackets.

**Dashboard**
Developed an interactive dashboard  incorporating various filters to allow stakeholders to explore the data dynamically. The dashboard featured visualizations such as bar charts, and line graphs to represent the data in an intuitive and easily interpretable manner.

This can provide stakeholders with valuable insights into customer purchasing patterns and can aid in better CRM, personalized service offerings, data-driven marketing strategies, customer targeting etc, enhancing overall customer satisfaction and drive growth.
